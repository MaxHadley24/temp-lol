Minutes from Previous Meeting
Product manager asked everyone what they had done yesterday, what they would do today, and if there were any roadblocks. Will Whatley faced a major setback for placing an order and having it confirmed for pick-up. He ran into some package download errors for .ejs and js and was setback and was not able to fully complete the item. We then thought of ways on how to split up the manager and server side privileges and what they can view. Server can only view input order pages while the manager can only view the business-side related pages. We then discussed how to implement Google OAuth and Google Translate and found they may be a little bit trickier to set up then the Google Maps API. We finished with discussing the different tests that could be conducted for our MVP.
