Minutes from Previous Meeting
Product manager asked everyone what they had done yesterday, what they would do today, and if there were any roadblocks. No one is facing any major roadblocks. We then brainstormed ways to implement the trends page user interface and the sales report interface. We finished by brainstorming more how to implement the google maps API. Use of CHATGPT here and found that we need to make a google cloud computing account to generate an API key.
