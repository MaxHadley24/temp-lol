Minutes from Previous Meeting
In this meeting we discussed what frameworks we would be using for the project. For this project, we decided to use express.js which will allow us to work the frontend and the backend with java script. We consulted our TA to obtain advice regarding our tools choice. We also decided to continue working on our sprint goals and came to the conclusion that we should be able to meet our sprint goals.
