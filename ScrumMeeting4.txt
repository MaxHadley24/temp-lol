Minutes from Previous Meeting
Product manager asked everyone what they had done yesterday, what they would do today, and if there were any roadblocks. We then went through the app and looked at how we could improve it and identified areas that needed immediate or high priority attention. We then brainstormed ways and wireframes to decide how to design the ordering page user interface. We also began brainstorming ways to implement inventory management and order history.
