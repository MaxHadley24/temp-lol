Minutes from Previous Meeting
In this meeting we continued discussing how we can integrate the postgresql database with the frontend framework. We then discussed how code refactoring from project 2 could help us in project 3. We ultimately decided that code from project 2 would serve as a guide, especially the DB queries for our project 3. For our next meeting we all need to come up with tests that will test our MVP for our users.
