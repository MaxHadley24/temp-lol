Minutes from Previous Meeting
This meeting was our first scrum meeting of the sprint and the project. There were no accomplishments since the previous meeting since this was the first one. In this meeting we decided what we were going to work on and we decided on the front-end tools that we could base our project on. For the front-end we decided on using html/css/bootstrap. We also created our repository and decided on what to do next. Our plan is to continue to work on sprint tasks, the front-end developers are to learn the basics of bootstrap and we need to decide on the back-end tool for next time.
